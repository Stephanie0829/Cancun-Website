	<ARTICLE>
		<p>Chichen Itza is both a Mayan city and present day archaeological site for discoveries relating to the Mayan people culture before European colonization. Many tourists come and see the ruins and architectural preservations. Located on the Yucatan peninsula, this destination was a center for both economic and political activities around the fifth century and after. The city had structures and suburb architecture out of stone, and was built on top of underground rivers and cenotes. Various attractions that can be seen include El Castello, the Great Ball Court, and various more preserved structures. </p>

		<h2>El Castello</h2>
		<p>El Castello is the pyramid triangular structure most notably known for in Chichen Itza. It is named after a serpent Mayan diety, and is also known as the Temple of KuKulKan. The structure is around 100 feet high. Once there is an equinox, the light and shadow creates a snake pattern along the architecture, with seven ridges formed by the steps.</p>

		<h2>The Great Ball Court</h2>
		<p>The ball court is the largest court in mesoasmerica, with a size of 166 by 68 meters. The walls are carved with members playing the ball game. There are multiple games; most notibly, there is the Pitz where a solid rubber ball of twenty pounds must be thrown into a hoop without the use of both hands.</p>
