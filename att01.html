		<p>The Ik-Kil cenote is located upon the Yucatan peninsula, and was originally used for Mayan sacrifice. The cenote is covered with greens, vines, and plants that drop from the top of the rocks. There is a sinkhole in a circular shape with vertical walls around the water. Next to the cenote, there are restaurants, hammocks, and hotels for resting. Present day, people can swim and jump into the water, swimming with little fish and other organisms. </br></br> Facts and Statistics:</p>
		<ul>To head into the cave, there is a limestone staircase that spans 85 feet</ul>
		<ul>The entire cenote is 130 feet and 200 feet wide, thus Ik-Kil is called the longest cave</ul>
		<ul>The cenote is also called the sacred cenote as it was where Mayans used to pray to their rain diety. Thousands of Mayans were sacrificed, lining the bottom of the cenote</ul>
